# Hoover POC

## Getting started

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. Install dependencies with `yarn`
3. Start development server with `yarn start`
4. Browse http://localhost:3000

> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How it works?

You can move a hoover into a room (materialized by a grid) with a list of instructions :
- `G` turn the hoover on the left
- `D` turn the hoover on the right
- `A` advance the hoover

> You can customize the initial position of the hoover and the grid.
